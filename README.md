# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As my first project I created a study guide for the prework I completed in the UCF coding boot camp. As a new software engineer, I'd like to create a place where I can store what I have learned in order to call upon this information in the future. There are many different resources that one could use, but in order to hone my skills, creating my own study guide was the best option.

Through the process of creating my own study guide, I worked out reworld coding issues and got practice debugging my own code. Learning through actual experience is a great way of commiting these new concepts to memory. Many of the the processes used to create this webpage are already feeling familiar.

I am learning that some of these concepts I have encountered in past jobs and didn't realize it. That being said, there is still a lot to learn and it will be an uphill battle to get to the finishline. The concept is familiar, but the languages are new and need a lot of polishing through trial and error.

## Usage

When utilizing this webpage, one can learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If the user opens the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. In addition, the user will be able to see the coding involved in putting this project together. The study guide can be dissected and be of more use than just the words on the page.
